# Online hangman challenge  
This is what I experimented in the system programming class final assignment.  
Usage:  
(1) Set this up on a server with a word you like.  
(2) Let someone else connect and challenge  
(3A) Try to guess the word, be laughed at loss, literally, enjoy.  
(3B) See the log on the server and enjoy
